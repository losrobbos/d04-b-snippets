# React Mini Projects

## Abbreviations & Terms

Bundler => an applicaton that "merged" javascript & other assets like CSS files together and optimizes them (e.g. reduce filesize so the assets load as quickly as possible in the browser)

Build process => the process that triggers the bundling & optimization. The result is usually a folder called "build" or "dist" (= distribution => optimized for distributing / deployment)

CRA => Create-React-App => an executable NPM package which will create a react project using the "bundler" WebPack

Vite => another build tool which uses "esbuild" under the hood for bundling instead of webpack. Esbuild is significantly faster that the WebPack bundler
